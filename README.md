========
It's Bluetooth LE communication library for Windows.
We can use Bluetooth LE API on Windows 8 or WinRT class(GattDeviceService) on Windows 8.1 when to communicate Bluetooth LE devices. But that functions not easy.
I provide helper functions for DeviceInformation and GattDeviceService classes.

Hot to use:
 1. Include mjwinble/mjwinble/bin/Release/mjwinble.dll to your project.


My envrionment is:
 Microsoft Windows 8.1.
 Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop.
